# FNV-algorithm
FNV algorithm implementation, java

To run the program

    1. javac <package>.RecursiveWalk.java
    2. java RecursiveWalk arg1 arg2
> arg1 - name of input file/directory, arg2 - name of output file

Program will recursively bypass the transferred directory and calculate the hash from each file using FNV algorithm

> Input file have to consist of names of directories/files

> Output file will consist of hash of current file and path to this file
